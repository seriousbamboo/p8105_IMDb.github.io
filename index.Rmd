# Introduction

Given the scenario of social distancing and temporary closure of movie theaters across the United States, the pandemic did hit the movie industry severly not only for a domestic market but also in a global scale. According to Comoscore, it has been a dramatic 76% drop in domestic box office in 2020 compared with the same point in 2019. Substantial restructing in the movie industry urge the producers and directors to be effective and efficient as much as possible. Box-office prediction has never been such a crucial problem in the film industry, such that profitability is directly associated with strategy made by investors and producers. In particular, we are interested in:

- What is the general trend of gross across time? Will this pattern vary for different genres?
- What is the association between Gross and other variables including IMDB_score, facebook_likes?
- Is director a significant predictor of Gross?
- the crude relationship between number of reviews and Gross





# Data

The main dataset for our project is a combined dataset from dataset on Kaggle and dataset reading from IMDb using the css selector. For our purpose, regression analysis will be the main method. Details about the data and analysis can be found in the section of Regression Analysis section.

# Findings

Genres really really don't matter in a broad scale, as long as the movie has a popular genre. Action, adventure and family are the top three genres that can ignite the gross. Surprisingly, family movie is another guarantee of the gross since family movies have a broader audiences. Horror, documentary and drama have the negative effect on gross.

The most influential factor that positively influence the gross is the number of genres. Other than the number of genres, factors that positively influence, with a great magnitude, the gross are number of critic for reviews and number of users for reviews. Ironically, IMDB scores negatively influence the gross dramatically. Why is? We believe that there exists an inconsistency between score and the gross, since none of the score related factors provides a strong and positive effect on gross. Such inconsistency may because only limited people actually score the movie.
